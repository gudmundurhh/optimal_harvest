Optimal Harvest Strategies for Predator Prey Systems
In this repository there are two folders. In the single species folder are codes that are used in deriving an optimal harvesting policy for the logistic growth equation using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. In the two interacting species folder there are used to derive the optimal harvest policy for the stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. 
Further descriptions can be found in the read me files in the folders.
